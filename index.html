        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a proud graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. My path
          towards becoming an engineer with a passion for coding took a
          significant turn during the 2022 ASUU strike, which allowed me the
          opportunity to explore new interests and skills. However, my
          connection with technology and my curiosity about how things work and
          how to fix them date back to my early years. Since then, I've been on
          an exciting and ever-evolving journey, continuously learning and
          expanding my coding skills. Whether it's developing software,
          designing solutions for real-world problems, or exploring the latest
          in technology trends, my passion for both mechanical engineering and
          coding has become an integral part of who I am. I look forward to the
          endless opportunities and challenges this path will bring and am
          excited to contribute to the world of technology and engineering in
          meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, I found myself captivated by the intricate world of
          technology. I often disassembled gadgets and devices to understand
          their inner workings, unraveling the mysteries behind their
          functionality. This process of dismantling and reassembling not only
          satisfied my inquisitiveness but also ignited my passion for solving
          complex problems and mastering the art of making things work
          seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I embarked on my journey into the realm of coding during that
          pivotal ASUU strike year, I discovered an entirely new dimension of
          technology. This world of coding introduced me to the endless
          possibilities of creating software, automating processes, and building
          innovative solutions. It was as if I had found the missing piece of
          the puzzle that allowed me to combine my mechanical engineering
          knowledge with the power of programming.
